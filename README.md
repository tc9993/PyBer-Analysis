<h1>PyBer Analysis</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>
The purpose of this project was to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, and provide an analysis of each item as well as business recommendations based on the data.
</p>

<h3>Analysis of City Type Summary</h3>

<b>Exhibit 1.1:</b> Summary by City Type
</p>
<p>
From the summary presented in Exhibit 1.1 it is evident that the majority of ride-sharing business occurs in an urban environment.  Accordingly, urban cities have the most in all "total" categories, but rural cities perform the best on a per ride and per driver basis.  Suburban city ride-sharing is the middle ground between both rural and urban in both aggregate and per ride/per driver statistics.  
</p>
<p>
These statistics are generally reflective of population densities in each city type where urban cities have the largest populations and thereby will provide a greater number of drivers and consume the most ride-shares as opposed to rural communities where populations are sparse and destinations are spread out.  These differences in distance from location to location could be accounting for the differences in Average Fare per Ride where an urban citizen is natively closer to their destination compared to someone in a rural community.
</p>
<p>
Of note is the differences in Total Drivers and Average Fare per Driver between city types.  In urban cities we see that there are more drivers than total rides, driving the Average Fare per Driver down significantly, whereas rural city drivers had almost a 2:1 ride to driver ratio, and an Average Fare per Driver of nearly 3.5x that from Urban cities.

<b>Exhibit 1.2:</b> Total Fare by City Type
</p>
<p>
As shown in Exhibit 1.2, urban cities drive the most total revenue via fares week over week.  This graph is backed by the summary in Exhibit 1.1 that showed, in an overall summary, how urban cities generated around 9.75x more fare than rural cities.  In each given week from January to April of 2019 urban cities generated the most fare, followed by suburban cities, with rural cities generating the least amount of fare.

<h3>Business Recommendations</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Data Collection:</b> To allow for expansion on this analysis, I would recommend collecting as much data as possible such as rider age, time of trip, trip distances, etc.  This would allow for more detailed analysis that extends beyond fare per ride or per driver.  Finding out the fare per distance and fare per minute could look drastically different as an addition to Exhibit 1.1 as well as tell us which cities are the most cost-effective ride-sharing solution for both patrons and the company.</li>
